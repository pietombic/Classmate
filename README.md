# Classmate 📚  
A social network designed for students, allowing them to share school notes with others from the same school. Students and schools can also publish events to advertise.

## 📌 Overview

**Classmate** was developed as a final-year high school project in collaboration with [**DMA Digital For Business**](https://github.com/DMA-digital-for-business), a company based in Cesena, Italy.  
The project consisted of a separate frontend and backend:

- **Frontend** (developed by [Pietro Tombaccini](https://github.com/pietombic))  
- **Backend** (developed by me)

Although the UI was not finished, the **backend is fully operational**, and all **API endpoints** work as intended.  
The system was designed to be modular and scalable, built using a microservices architecture with an access gateway.

## 🚧 Project Status
This project is **no longer actively maintained** and is not intended to be installed or used in production.  
It is published on GitHub for **showcase** and portfolio purposes.
The database backup contains only mock data for demonstration.
This repository is a copy of the original one that had too many sensistive data in it's history to be public.

## 🗂 Key Features (Backend)
Despite being incomplete, the backend implements several core features:

- Student registration and authentication  
- User–school association  
- Note uploads via AWS S3  
- Sharing content with other students from the same school  
- Microservices structure ready for future independent modules
